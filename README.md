# plex-api-credentials [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/phillipj/node-plex-api-credentials.png)](http://travis-ci.org/phillipj/node-plex-api-credentials)

[plex-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plex-api) authenticator module which provides PlexHome credentials authentication.

*It's usually not required to install and handle this package explicitly, as username/password/managed user credentials
can be specified when creating an plex-api client.*

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install plex-api-credentials --save
```

Then provide the plex-api-credentials object to the plex-api client upon creation:

```js
const PlexAPI = require('plex-api');
const credentials = require('plex-api-credentials');

const userAndPass = credentials({
    username: 'MainParentUser',
    password: 'aSecretPassword',
    managedUser: {    // Required for Plex managed users
        name: 'RestrictedFamilyMember',
        pin: '1234' // Optional four digit pin code if user is protected
    }
});

const client = new PlexAPI({
    hostname: '192.168.0.1',
    authenticator: userAndPass
});

// use PlexAPI client as usual
client.find('/library/sections', ...);
```

## Events

### `token`

Emitted whenever a token has been retrieved from plex.tv.

### Usage

```js
userAndPass.on('token', function(token){
    // possibly cache retrieved token here?
});
```
